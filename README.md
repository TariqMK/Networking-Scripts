# Networking Scripts
A collection of simple BAU Networking Scripts I have compiled. Focusing mainly on Cisco Routers and Switches, with forays into retreiving data from automation platforms such as Cisco DNA Centre.

## Prerequisites
Scripts in this Repository assume that relevant versions of Python are installed.

Scripts which require specific third-party libraries will have them mentioned in the appropriate README file.

## Disclaimer
Do not assume scripts from this repository execute without any errors. Always double check the code first. I am not responsible for any unexpected outcomes.
