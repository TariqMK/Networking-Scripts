# Networking Scripts
A collection of simple BAU Networking Scripts I have compiled. Focusing mainly on Cisco Routers and Switches.

## Prerequisites
Scripts in this Repository assume that relevant versions of Python and Netmiko are installed.

## Disclaimer
Do not assume scripts from this repository execute without any errors. Always double check the code first. I am not responsible for any unexpected outcomes.
